**Walshop is a online and simple clothing store concept, inspired by online wave of ecommerce during the past couple of years.**

Technologies: HTML/CSS/Boostrap/JavaScript/Postgresql/Python/Django

### Here are my procedure for this project:

   - Designed general layout of shopping store 
   - Created fully responsive templates for initial signin/signup, home page, and contact form (Html/CSS/Bootstrap)
   - Added Django to project to create models/views and functionality
   - Added the package, django-allauth, package to help with authenication and user validation.
   - Allowed CRUD operations for the product-list, product-editing with Django models and forms
   - Deployed the website to an remote database via Heroku and Postgresql
   - Separate each steps and structurized it to allow for easier debuging
